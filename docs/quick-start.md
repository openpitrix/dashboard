The **Runtime Provider** can be selected, but **Kubernetes** is different from other vm-based environment application configuration package formats. **QingCloud** and **AWS** can be selected at the same time, which means the application in the current **Repo** can be deployed to **QingCloud** or **AWS**.

After the **Repo** is created, you can find that the application has been imported automatically. If the application in the **Reppo** has been updated, it can be updated by **Trigger indexer** in operation

### 4. View deployment status
You can view the application instance you just deployed in the operations center, including a Wordpress cluster and a frontgate cluster, and the creation is successful when the cluster status is shown as active.

> Frontgate is responsible for metadata storage and functions such as communication between the OpenPitrix framework and the application instance host

### 5. View Wordpress
The host status and IP can be viewed from [QingCloud Console](https://console.qingcloud.com/pek3a/instances/)

You can enter the network environment where VPC is located through VPN, or you can access the Wordpress home page by forwarding and then accessing the public network IP + forwarding port bound by VPC through the VPC configuration port.
